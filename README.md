# Access, creation times distribution
investigate the frequency of creation and last modification time of files

This is to begin investigating the accumulation of 'junk' versus useful files, and how it is distributed.

Should really look at the relationship between creation and last access times.

Background: I'm interested in the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, where here we see file creation as exploration, and access as exploitation.
